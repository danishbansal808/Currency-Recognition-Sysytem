ABOUT PROJECT

    Vision:

        The app will be helpful for visually impaired persons, who often have difficulty identifying denominations of currency notes. With the app, the user can identify a currency note through a picture clicked by phone's camera. It will then give a voice intimation to the user.
    
    
    Description:
        The name of this project is “Indian Currency Detection”. In this project we will detect the Indian currency using deep learning and Convolutional neural networks. Our project is basically a social project, to help out the visually impaired peoples all around the India.
            •	In this project there we can upload a image from our local machine.
            •	Then we have to load the deep learning model.
            •	After model has been loaded, now model is ready to predict the image.
            •	Then click the predict button, which will predict the uploaded image.
            •	System will sound the predicted image result.

    Dataset:

        Our Dataset is like:
        
        ![See Sample Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/datsets/Annotation%202019-11-17%20013539.png)

        435 images of 10 rupee notes
        437 images of 20 rupee notes
        447images of 50 rupee notes
        413images of 100 rupee notes
        402images of 500 rupee notes
        437images of 1000 rupee notes
        Which is further divided into test and training set randomly.
        So training and test set contains 
        427 in training set and 81 in test set of 10 rupee notes
        434 in training set and 84 in test set of 20 rupee notes
        444 in training set and 88 in test set of 50 rupee notes
        410 in training set and 79 n test set of 100 rupee notes
        394 in training set and 79 in test set of 500 rupee notes
        430 in training set and 85 in test set of 1000 rupee notes

     Model Train and Test Accuracy: 

            Train Accuracy: 96.32
            Test Accuracy: 98.85

        
    Future Work To do:

        We are trying to work on an android application which give us an interface on android operating system.
        This android application will simply scan the image using smart phone camera and then predict the required result as a sound which will help visually impaired people to identify the currency
